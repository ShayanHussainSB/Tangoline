	<p align="center"><b>Microsoft's <span style="color: lightblue">Xbox</span> One and Sony's  <span style="color: lightblue">PlayStation 4 </span> are constantly evolving — both consoles have gotten slimmer designs, new features and, naturally, lots of big games since they first launched. The Xbox One has tons of entertainment apps and can play a bunch of Xbox 360 games, while the PS4 has continued to double-down on key exclusives and user-friendliness. There are even spruced-up versions of both systems that offer things like HDR video playback and 4K gaming.</b></p><br><br>
	<p align="center"><b>More importantly, the Xbox One and PS4 both have tons of great games, and are both available for less than $300. But which console should you choose? We've put the Xbox One and PS4 up against each other in an eight-round brawl to determine which system is strongest.</b></p><br><br>
	<p align="center"><b>Editors' Note: Looking for Sony's and Microsoft's newest consoles? Check out our face-off between the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S right here.</b></p>
	<h1><b>Game Library:</b></h1><br><br>
	<p align="center"><b>Both PS4 and Xbox One play many of this generation's best titles, from third-party blockbusters such as Fallout 4, Doom and Resident Evil 7, to beloved indies like Shovel Knight, Inside and Rocket League</b></p><br><br>
	<p align="center"><b>Still, PS4 is winning the exclusives war by a mile. Between big hits such as Uncharted 4, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Bloodborne and Persona 5, the PS4's exclusive offerings include a healthy mix of AAA blockbusters, niche Japanese titles and notable indies. PS4 players also get first dibs on downloadable content for several big games, such as Destiny 2 and the recent Call of Duty titles.</b></p>

<div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px;">
	<p align="center" ><b>That's not to say the Xbox One is devoid of great first party games — titles such as Gears of War 4, Halo 5, Forza Horizon 3 and Sunset Overdrive are all major standouts. Xbox One is the only console you'll get to play the wildly popular PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds on this fall, and is the exclusive console home to major indie games such as Tacoma and Cuphead.</b></p><br><br>
	<p align="center"><b>Most sports games come to both systems, though Sony's MLB: The Show series is exclusive to PlayStation. PS4 has a healthier fighting game lineup (Street Fighter V, Guilty Gear Xrd: Revelator, King of Fighters XIV), though Microsoft's platform is the exclusive home to Killer Instinct.</b></p>
	<p><b><h3>Winner: PS4.</h3> Both systems play tons of great games, but Sony's system has more hit games that you can only play on a console.</b></p>
</div>
<div class="container">
	<h1><b>Backwards Compatibility and Services</b></h1><br><br>
	<p><b>You don't necessarily need an Xbox One to play some of Microsoft's biggest first-party games. As part of Microsoft's Play Anywhere initiative, you can buy digital versions of games such as ReCore and Forza Horizon 3 once and play them on Xbox One and on Windows 10. While this is a great value, those who have a decent gaming PC arguably have no reason to buy an Xbox One.</b></p>
</div><br><br>

</div><br><br>
<div class="container">
	<p align="center"><b>If you have a massive library of Xbox 360 games, however, the Xbox One might be a better buy for you. More than 300 Xbox 360 games are currently playable on Microsoft's new console, including Mass Effect, Fallout 3 and the entire Gears of War series, and Microsoft has been adding support for new 360 titles on a near-weekly basis. The Xbox One will even support games from the original 2001 Xbox soon.<br><br><br>
You can play older games on PS4, but not without paying up. A small selection of digital PS2 classics are available on Sony's new console for about $15 a pop, each scaled up to 1080p with earnable trophies and support for features such as Share Play and Remote Play.
The PS4 plays PS3 games via PlayStation Now, which allows you to stream hundreds of last-gen titles (and a few PS4 games) from the cloud for $10 a month or $100 a year. In contrast, Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass grants access to over 100 Xbox One and Xbox 360 games that you can download for $10 a month. Xbox One is also the exclusive home of EA Access, which lets you play an ever-growing library of EA games for $30 a year or $5 a month.<br><br>
<h3>MORE:</h3> PlayStation Now vs. Xbox Game Pass: What's Worth Your Cash?<br><br>
<h1>Winner: Xbox One.</h1> Xbox One plays hundreds of Xbox 360 games, offers cross-play with PC and lets you binge on two generations' worth of games for a good price.
</b></p>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h1><b>Hardware</b></h1>
<p>The latest iterations of both consoles (the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S) are both impressively sleek, offering attractive designs that look great under a TV and can fit into a backpack without a problem. The newest PS4 has a slight edge in terms of sheer smallness, though it lacks an optical input for high-end gaming headsets.</p>
<div class="col-md-12">
	<img src="http://www.psx-place.com/attachments/playstation4-250-update-jpg.5899/" width="100%" height="600"><br><br>
	<p align="center"><b>Sony's 4K-ready PS4 Pro has a chunkier, hamburger-like design, while the upcoming Xbox One X, which is even more powerful than the Pro, is somehow slimmer than the Xbox One S. The chunky launch Xbox One from 2013 has thankfully been discontinued.</b></p>
	<div class="col-md-12">
		<img src="https://compass-ssl.xbox.com/assets/ea/f9/eaf9cfd8-0c54-4bc9-9d88-c3f93955120f.jpg?n=X1S_gallery_1056x594_10.jpg" width="100%" height="600">
		<p align="center"><b>Both consoles start with 500GB of storage that you can easily expand by connecting an external hard drive. PS4 owners also have the option of opening up their consoles to swap in a new 2.5-inch or SATA drive.<br><br><br>
Each controller has its perks -- the Xbox One pad has textured grips and can be customized via the Xbox Design Lab, while Sony's DualShock 4 is highly ergonomic and has a touchpad and reactive lightbar. The PS4 controller is the only one that supports micro USB charging right out of the box — Xbox One owners will need to rely on AA batteries or buy a $25 charging kit.
Thanks to the $399 PlayStation VR headset, PS4 is the only of the two consoles to currently support virtual reality (it's pretty good at it, too).<br><br> There's currently no equivalent for Xbox One, though Microsoft's upcoming mixed reality headsets are expected to eventually work with the Xbox One family.
Winner: PS4. Sony's console is more attractive, packs a more feature-rich controller and currently is the only of the two to support virtual reality.</b></p>

	<h1><b>Performance and Graphics</b></h1>
	<p><b>If you're concerned about nuts and bolts, both of these graphically muscular machines have an 8-core x86-64 AMD Jaguar processor with 8GB of RAM, an AMD Radeon GPU and a 500GB hard drive.
While games generally look and play great on both systems, PS4 has the edge in terms of resolution. For example, according to IGN's database, games such as Batman: Arkham Knight and Shadow of Mordor all run at full 1080p on PS4, while Xbox One gamers have to settle for 900p on those titles. If getting the best possible crispness for most games is a priority, PS4 comes out on top.<br><br>
However, the performance conversation is now much more complicated. The new $399 PS4 Pro offers a beefed-up GPU that allows for 4K gaming. Microsoft will answer this fall with the $499 Xbox One X, a 4K-ready console whose official specs are even more powerful than the Pro.<br><br>
Folks with HDR-ready TVs should also consider High Dynamic Range support, which allows for richer colors and better brightness. The Xbox One X, Xbox One S, PS4 Pro and standard PS4 all support HDR, though the list of HDR-enabled games varies by console.<br><br>
<b>Winner:</b> PS4. Games look stunning on both systems, but the stock PS4 offers better resolution for many titles, and offers a 4K-gaming-ready iteration.</b></p><br><br>
<h1><b>User-Friendliness</b></h1>
<p><b>The Xbox One's ever-evolving interface is fairly intuitive, with large app icons, shortcuts for getting to your games quickly, and a guide menu that lets you see friends, track achievements and take screenshots with a quick button tap.<br><br>
The PS4 is still king in terms of capturing gameplay moments and sharing them with friends. A quick tap of the DualShock 4's Share button lets you record a clip, broadcast your gameplay or take a screenshot. And the PS4-exclusive Share Play feature lets you give control of your game to an online friend for up to 60 minutes, so long as that person has Plus.<br><br>
Both consoles can broadcast gameplay directly to Twitch, though only PS4 can stream to YouTube. PS4 players can share their screenshots and videos to Facebook and Twitter, whereas Xbox owners are limited to the latter network. Xbox One gamers have the option of streaming to Microsoft's Mixer service.<br><br>
Both systems also permit off-TV play, for those times the family is hogging the living room. Sony's Remote Play feature lets you stream PS4 games to a PlayStation Vita handheld, select Xperia devices, or your PC and Mac. Xbox One players, on the other hand, can stream their games to their Windows 10 laptops or tablets.<br><br>
<b>Winner:<b> PS4. Sony's system continues to have more-intuitive options for broadcasting gameplay and sharing with friends.</b></p>
